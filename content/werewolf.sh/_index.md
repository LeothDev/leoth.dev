## Why This Game?

My inner child is eager to live again those countless nights,  
playing WereWolf in random Telegram groups.  
There are mobile apps now, sure, but I want something more...  
...terminal-native. I need something simple and aesthetic.  
Something where the social aspect is the main goal.

## So, What Is {{< code >}}werewolf.sh{{< /code >}}?
A real-time multiplayer WereWolf game that runs *entirely*  
in your terminal over SSH. No web browsers, no mobile apps.  
No installation needed - just pure terminal goodness.
